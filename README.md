<p><h1>C Requirements:</h1></p>
  <p>Flaws:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The alarm button is too close to the keyholes for various elevator functions (i.e. lights).</li>
    <li>There is a great amount of empty space between the last buttons and the device that indicates the current floor.</li>
    <li>There is no Braille for the key slots so a blind person would not be able to understand those. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Pros:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The buttons are very nicely laid out.</li>
    <li>There is Braille on the floor and open/close buttons.</li>
    <li>Elevator has additional functionality turned on/off through keys.</li>
    <li>Very obvious display to show current floor.</li>
  </ul>
