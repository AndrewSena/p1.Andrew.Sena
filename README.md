<p><h1>C Requirements:</h1></p>
  <p>Flaws:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The alarm button is too close to the keyholes for various elevator functions (i.e. lights).</li>
    <li>There is a great amount of empty space between the last buttons and the device that indicates the current floor.</li>
    <li>There is no Braille for the key slots so a blind person would not be able to understand those. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Pros:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The buttons are very nicely laid out.</li>
    <li>There is Braille on the floor and open/close buttons.</li>
    <li>Elevator has additional functionality turned on/off through keys.</li>
    <li>Very obvious display to show current floor.</li>
  </ul>

<p><h1>B Requirements</h1></p>
<p>Common Uses of an Elevator</p>
<ul>
  <li>Moves between floors</li>
  <li>Open and close the door</li>
  <li>Displaying the current floor</li>
</ul>
<p>Rare Uses of an Elevator</p>
<ul>
  <li>Emergency Stop/Alarm</li>
  <li>Turn lights on/off</li>
  <li>Turn elevator on/off</li>
</ul>
These common uses heavily rely on the interface to even function.
<p>Sequence of Actions</p>
<ol>
  <li>Person calls elevator by button on their current floor.</li>
  <li>Elevator moves to the floor it was called to and then opens the doors.</li>
  <li>Person moves into elevator and uses other interface to choose another floor to move to.</li>
  <li>Elevator moves to requested floor and opens doors.</li>
  <li>User leaves the elevator.</li>
</ol>
<p>Elevator Supports the user by</p>
<ul>
  <li>Buttons are labled and have Braille.</li>
  <li>Users know which floor they are on.</li>
  <li>Provides feedback when users press buttons.</li>
  <li>The elevator provides optional functionality to the user (interior lights).</li>
</ul>
<p>How does the L + Evator provide feedback.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Buttons change color to indicate they have been pressed.</li>
  <li>A visual number is displayed to show user what floor the elevator is on.</li>
  <li>The elevator provides a audible ding to announce to the user the selected floor has been reached.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common Mistakes made in Elevator</p>
<ul>
  <li>The user presses the wrong button.</li>
  <li>The user stays in the door of the elevator</li>
  <li>The user presses multiple buttons despite only wanting to press one.</li>
  <li>The user might accidentally press the alarm button.</li>
  <li>Users might bump into the chest height buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggested improvements for elevator</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move emergency buttons higher up the interface to avoid accidental use</li>
  <li>Seperate floor buttons and open/closer door buttons slightly to ensure user does not mistake one for the other.</li>
  <li>Keep additional functionality key slots seperate from the emergency alarm button so no user mistakenly presses it while attempting to use the other functionality.</li>
</ul>
