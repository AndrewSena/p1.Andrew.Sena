<p>C Requirements:</p>
  Flaws:
    The alarm button is too close to the keyholes for various elevator functions (i.e. lights). There is a great amount of empty space between the last buttons and the       device that indicates the current floor. There is no Braille for the key slots so a blind person would not be able to understand those. 
  Pros:
    The buttons are very nicely laid out.
    There is Braille on the floor and open/close buttons.
    Elevator has additional functionality turned on/off through keys.
    Very obvious display to show current floor.
